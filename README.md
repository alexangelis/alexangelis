Hi I am Alexandros! I am a Computer Science for Business final year student at Aston University. I am keen in Finance & Graphic Design, where I have experience through my second year team project. During my placement year, I spent one semester in Madrid, Spain, studying at Carlos III Universidad de Madrid, where I specialised in Finance & Accounting, and another semester working at UNESCO of Greece in the position of customer experience and web developing.
